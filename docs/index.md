  If you want to control the robot from a GUI, you will have to write your own.
- **Dobot official documentation** - is kinda crap, its hard to read and
  understand. DobotAPI tries to make it easier to understand.
- **For the time being, it lacs a lot of features** - It's a young project,
  and it's still in development. It's missing a lot of features, and it's
  not very well tested. If you want to help, you can contribute to the
  project.
